# Babylonjs Game Starter

## A basic starting point for your Babylonjs Game Project, built on Webpack, Express.js.

<br/>

This project assumes you will use

- TypeScript for the game logic
- JavaScript for Express.js server code.

<br/>

## Getting Started

Initiate your project by running below command in the directory of your choice:
<br/>
(Replace \<my-app\> with your choice of project name)

```
npx babylonjs-game-starter <my-app>
```

- This will generate package.json, and
- Initialize git

Then, make sure to install dependencies.

```
npm install
```

Then, compile typescipt files by running:

```
npx tsc
```

Or you can install TypeScript globally to use the global `tsc` command.

```
npm i -g typescript
```

```
tsc
```

To start the development server, run:

```
npm start
```

To build your project for production, run:

```
npm run build
```
